# Fraus

Fraus is a rendering engine based on Vulkan.
See the [wiki](https://github.com/alexisrdt/Fraus/wiki) for a documentation.

![Demo example](https://github.com/alexisrdt/Fraus/blob/main/demo/example.png)

## Using

To use Fraus:
- Make sure you have Vulkan installed on your machine (not necessarily through the SDK)
- Make sure Fraus has access to Vulkan's header files
- Compile Fraus as a library or use the source in your project

You can also run and edit the demo application to experiment with Fraus.
