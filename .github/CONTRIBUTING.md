# Contributing to Fraus

If you want to contribute to Fraus, there are two possibilities:

## Issue

You can open an issue explaining what your suggestion is, what situation led to the need of modifying Fraus as well as implementation suggestions.

## Pull request

You can create a pull request for the same matter and when you feel like you are confident enough to implement the whole thing.
When doing this, please keep the same coding conventions as the rest of the project.
Your pull request will be reviewed and may end up merged into the project, or if the idea is great but the implementation is not suitable,
it will be reimplementated and credit will be given when it ends up in the project.
