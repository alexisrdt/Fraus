				<h2>What is Fraus?</h2>
				<p>
					Fraus is a rendering engine based on Vulkan.
					It is written in C(99) to maximize portability and match Vulkan's requirements.
				</p>

				<h2>Capabilities</h2>
				<p>
					Fraus is still in development.
					It is currently able to render several textured models in a 3D scene
					and records commands with multiple threads. <br />
					It also has a perspective camera which can easily be used to navigate the scene. <br />
					There is a demo application available in the repository to test and experiment with Fraus.
				</p>

				<h2>Plans</h2>
				<p>
					I would like to make it possible to have multiple graphics pipelines and render passes in order to create real applications. <br />
					I could then explore the compute pipelines as well as ray tracing. <br />
					I may work on adding a GUI around Fraus to make it easier to edit scenes.
