				<h2>Installation</h2>
				<p>
					To install Fraus, you first need to clone the repository.
					You also need to make sure Fraus has access to the Vulkan headers and libraries, but the SDK is not mandatory. <br />
					Then, you can either build Fraus as a static library or as a shared library, or paste the code directly into your project.
